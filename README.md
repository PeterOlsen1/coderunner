This is the place to be for programmers looking to increase their typing speed, while also learning the syntax of various differnet languages. Inspired by monkeytype, coderunner is a minimalist typing speed game to test how good of a typist you really are.

The code isn't randomly generated, which means I need you, the user, to upload passages of your own for others to test their speed on.

So what are you waiting for? Head over to <a href="https://code-runner.web.app">coderunner</a> and start typing today!
